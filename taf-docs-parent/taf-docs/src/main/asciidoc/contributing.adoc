= How to Contribute Documentation

== Getting started

=== 1. Create a document

Documentation content is managed in the
link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc]
format (syntax cheatsheet
link:http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[available online]).

To add a document, crate an *.adoc* file in *taf-docs/src/main/asciidoc*, in root or a subfolder.
Full AsciiDoc syntax can be used to format document content,
but there are a few TAF docs specifics in addition to common AsciiDoc features.
Refer to the link:#_formatting[formatting] section for details.

=== 2. Add to TOC

The table of contents generator uses two configuration files: *_toc.xml* and *_title.adoc*.
Both can be found at *taf-docs/src/main/asciidoc*.

- *_toc.xml* contains a file tree from document root represented in plain XML.
  In order for new documents to be included in TOC, they should be specified in this file,
  with a correct path.
- *_title.adoc* is a template used as a header for the TOC page.
  It contains everything placed before the actual TOC link list.

=== 3. Exclude files from conversion

To exclude a file from ending up in target, its name must be prefixed by an underscore, e.g.

- Visible: +file.adoc+
- Hidden: +_file.adoc+

=== 4. Build everything

Maven is used to process and build documentation from sources.
To do this, in the root of the project execute a shell command:

    mvn package

This takes all *.adoc* files in *taf-docs/src/main/asciidoc* and converts them to the appropriate format.
The resulting HTML is then found in *taf-docs/target/generated-html*.

== Formatting

=== Linking to other documents

When converting from AsciiDoc to HTML the relative path to the *.adoc* file is flattened.
This is done as a countermeasure for converter _plugin limitations_.
The flattening is done by replacing slashes in the file path to dashes like so:

    components/monitoring/thresholds.adoc -> components-monitoring-thresholds.adoc

This behaviour should be taken into account when linking to other documents,
as the links containing file paths won't be automatically converted.
So, the correct way to make a link to the above document is:

    link:components-monitoring-thresholds.adoc[Thresholds]

=== Adding code snippets from file

Source files in *taf-examples* module are copied over to target directory during build.
Embed any of them in a document like so:

    [source,groovy]
    ----
    include::examples/groovy/HelloWorld.groovy[]
    ----

This would embed the file at
link:../../../taf-examples/src/main/groovy/HelloWorld.groovy[taf-examples/src/main/groovy/HelloWorld.groovy]
(demonstrated below):

[source,groovy]
----
include::examples/groovy/HelloWorld.groovy[]
----

=== Embedding images

To embed an image in a document, you don't need to link to the flattened path, as it is with AsciiDoc documents.
Just specify a path relative to documentation root *taf-docs/src/main/asciidoc*.
A good idea is to put new images in the *images* folder or a subfolder.

    image:images/ericsson.png[]

image:images/ericsson.png[]
