====================

Local is the host you are running on.

What is the TAF Local Command Executor?
---------------------------------------

The TAF local command executor is an API which allows you to execute
commands on the machine the JVM is running on.

[[LocalCommandExecutor-Howtogetstarted]]
How to get started
------------------

This API just has the default constructor so start with that

LocalCommandExecutor executor = new LocalCommandExecutor()
----------------------------------------------------------

It has 2 overloaded methods to execute commands. Both are overloaded in
the same way, they either take a string with the command and arguments
in one string or they take a string with the command and a String array
with all the arguments. The main difference is in what they return,
execute returns a boolean for success or failure and simpleExec returns
a string which contains the response of the command.Â  The stdout, dtderr
and exit code from the command are also available using methods
getStdOut() getErrOut getExitCode().

code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false---------------------------------------------------
code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false
String response = executor.simplExec("ls -al")
boolean success = executor.execute("ls", "-a", "l")

String stdOut= executor.getStdOut()
String stdErr= executor.getErrOut()
int exitCode= executor.getExitCode()
