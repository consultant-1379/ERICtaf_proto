What is the TAF JBOSS Handler?
------------------------------

The TAF JBOSS handler is an API which simplifies the interactions with
JBOSS.

[[JBOSSHandler-Howtogetstarted]]
How to get started
------------------

Firstly you need to create an instance of the JBOSSHandler

code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false
JbossHandler jboss = new JbossHandler(jbossNode, serverThatHostsJbossInstance)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first argument is a
https://arm1s11-eiffel004.eiffel.gic.ericsson.se:8443/nexus/content/sites/tor/ERICtaf_util/taf/data-handler/apidocs/index.html[Host
object] which is the jboss node you want to interact with. The second
optional argument is another host object which is the server the node is
located on if you are connecting to it remotely. If this argument is not
specified, remote access to Jboss is used only.

Please note to use deployment service, management port will need to be
specified in Host object as well as Management Real user.

Please note to use JMX service of JBOSS handler, JMX port needs to be
specified in the host object as well as Management Realm user.

 

Once you have instantiated the jboss handler you can deploy, activate or
undeploy a file.

code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false-----------------------------------------
code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false
boolean deployed = jboss.deployFile(file)
-----------------------------------------

The deployFile method’s first argument is the file to deploy, in the
form of a file object. It also has 2 optional arguments. First is a
boolean activate, this specifies whether the file should be executed
once it is deployed. The second optional argument is another boolean
which decides whether to force deploy the file or not, if this is set to
true the file will be deployed regardless of the current state.

code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false---------------------------------------------------------
code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false
boolean activated  = jboss.activateDeployedFile(filename)
---------------------------------------------------------

The activate deployed file has just one argument, the string filename of
the file to activate.

code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false-------------------------------------------------
code,theme:,Confluence;,brush:,groovy;,gutter:,false
boolean undeployed = jboss.undeployFile(filename)
-------------------------------------------------

The undeploy file method’s first argument is the string filename to
undeploy. It also has an optional second argument, this is a boolean,
which if set to true removes the file from the jboss node filesystem.

When an instance of the JbossHandler is created 2 more objects are
created in the constructor, an instance of JBOSS Command Executor and
JMX Handler. How these can be used to work with your jboss node are
detailed in pages under this page.
