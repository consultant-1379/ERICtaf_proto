= Setting up TAF for First time

== Introduction

In this section we will bring the user through setting up TAF for
the first time. First and for most please read the link:introduction.html[Introduction]
section which includes what TAF is about in slides on how it works and
videos on getting started. These should give the user a good start on
creating a new project.

=== TAF JavaDoc

https://arm1s11-eiffel004.eiffel.gic.ericsson.se:8443/nexus/content/sites/tor/ERICtaf_util/

== Environment - Eclipse, Maven, GIT

Setting up the environment for the first time.
TAF project is a http://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html[Maven] project.

In order to run TAF the user will need the following 

* Eclipse E4e (Ericsson's version of Eclipse)
* Maven Apache server
* Maven Plugin for Eclipse
* Groovy Plugin for Eclipse - not really required but may be needed to
  view *taf-core* when troubleshooting and to navigate Java docs in Eclipse
* EGit plugin for eclipse

=== Development Environment

The link below will show the user from the TAF team's setup how to setup
the environments from scratch. *Please note to check your own team if
they have their own environment setup.*

http://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/TAF/Development+Environment+Setup[Development Environment Setup] -
This link contains instructions to setup
Eclipse E4E, GIT, Maven Apache Server, EGIT (Eclipse plugin) JBoss, JDK.

=== Maven plugin

Follow this link below to install Maven m2e for Eclipse.
You may also need to install the *Eclipse marketplace* plugin.

http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/maven-integration-eclipse#.UWbI7lROixo

=== Groovy Plugin

Follow this link below to install Groovy.
You may also need to install the *Eclipse marketplace* plugin.

http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/groovy-eclipse-juno#.UWbJh1ROixo

=== Other Installations

Within your team you may need the following but please check with your team.

* Git –> This can be found in the in the link above to show you
  how to setup Git and set an SSH key.
* JBoss Application server – depending on your project you may use JBoss.
  Please check with your team.

=== JBoss

The CM Mediation Team have created a good setup with pre-written
standalone file that will provide a quick setup of JBoss.

NOTE: This is not Managed by TAF

== AVS

AVS is used to firstly store your test cases that have been created
using FreeMind. Freemind is a tool that allows the user to map out the
test cases they wish to use. The freemind map for each team can then be
stored in the AVS webpage https://cifwk-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/. The
Freemind map will then be taken and converted into Test cases structure
of TAF when uploaded to the website. The user can then take the code
produced and continue to write your code. Please see slides on
http://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/TAF/Introduction[introduction]
page on AVS

1. Get Freemind AVS template -
   https://ericoll.internal.ericsson.com/sites/Integration_Verification/core_CI_Framework/Test%20Automation/Blank_AVS_template.mm[AVS Template]
2. Use template to create freemind map of Test cases
3. Upload AVS template to website  https://cifwk-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/
4. Download zip file of generate TAF testcases
5. Add Test case classes and add suite.xml in src/resource folder
6. User can now add their code to the test structure or *Archetype*

== Archetype

The Archetype is a Maven template project that has already been setup
with TAF to run Test cases. It comes with example testcases for remote
file handling and also a Rest example.

For starting out this is a quick and easy way of starting off with using
TAF to setup your Test cases.

The link below will explain how to run the Archetype command using the
maven apache server to generate the project. Once this is completed
simply import the Maven Project into eclipse run the example test cases
to see it working. The Team can now use this project as there

NOTE: The user will have to change the package names to name the
      project has been given when creating the Archetype. This is not
      automatically generated from the Archetype.

http://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/TAF/Create+TAF-based+test+project[Generating the Archetype]

The user has now all essential tools to start creating Test cases.

http://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/RRPM/TAF+on+Linux+HUB[TAF on Linux HUB] -
for people working in the HUB to generate the archetype and have issues with the maven settings xml

== Things you should know when getting started

TAF package comes complete with handlers for JBoss, RMI etc. TAF uses
properties files to store Host connections and for its monitoring and
threshold functionality which is used to chart for example CPU, Memory
etc usage when testcases are run. This is linked to the JCat report that
is produced by TAF once completed. Please see inside TAF for more
information link:inside-taf.html[Inside TAF]

=== DataHandlers

From the properties file the user can get this information by using the
https://arm1s11-eiffel004.eiffel.gic.ericsson.se:8443/nexus/content/sites/tor/ERICtaf_util/taf/data-handler/apidocs/index.html[*DataHandler*] class
to retrieve property information that is stored in the resource folder,
on the classpath or in the project folders. Data Handler can also get OS
environment properties as well and is a central point for data
retrieval. This class can be used to get the Host properties that is
needed for example to add into the JBoss handlers. For example:

NOTE: All property files must be stored in
      src/main/resources/*taf_properties* in the project folder.

.Example: get all JBoss instances
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Get all the host objects from all data sources and return in a list
 * @return a list of Host objects.
 */
public static List<Host> getHosts() { ... }

List<Host> result = new ArrayList<Host>();
for (Host potentialNode : DataHandler.getHosts()) {
    if (potentialNode.getType() == HostType.JBOSS)
        result.add(potentialNode);
}
return result;
----


.Example: get my first node
[source,java]
----
Host host = Datahandler.getHostByName("sc1");
----

The Host Properties file value takes the form.

    host.hostname.property = value
    host.hostname.node.nodename.property = value


.Example: Host Properties file
----
host.sc1.type=sc1
host.sc1.ip=10.12.1.17
host.sc1.user=root
host.sc1.pass=12shroot
host.sc1.port.ssh=22
host.sc1.node.firstNode.type=jboss
host.sc1.node.firstNode.port.http=8080
host.sc1.node.firstNode.user=admin
host.sc1.node.firstNode.pass=adminPass
host.sc1.node.firstNode.port.jmx=9999
host sc1.node.secondNode.type=jboss
host.sc1.node.secondNode.port.http=8081
host.sc1.node.secondNode.port.jmx=10000
host.sc1.node.secondNode.user=admin
host.sc1.node.secondNode.pass=adminPass
----

=== Monitoring

Please see this link to slides on monitoring and the basic setting up of
properties files for Monitoring

link:hands-on-monitoring.html[Hands on Monitoring] 

=== Thresholds

Goal of threshold is to add verification logic to data collected by
monitor. This logic can be used to log or warn if a specific event
occurs or even fail a test case if some characteristic criteria are
violated. Please see link:thresholds.html[Thresholds]

Thresholds are configured using properties similar to ones used for
monitors. Currently thresholds can be applied only to numerical values.
