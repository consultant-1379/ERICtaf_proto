== Null Host Returned

*Question:* The Following code snippet returns _null_Host:

[source,java]
----
final Host host = DataHandler.getHostByType(HostType._RC_);
if (host == null) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No host of type"
        + HostType._RC_.toString() + "was found");
}
return host;
----

*Answer:* The reason why this might be happening is that the hosts
properties file is not placed at the right location, i.e. taf_properties
folder.

It is important to note that, DataHandler will not be able to fetch host
information if the properties file is placed in the classpath.

*Answer:* TafRun.groovy file is out of date. The latest version of the
file will need to be downloaded to the TAF project. This can be fetched
by cloning the following repo and copying from location:
`src/main/resources/scripts'

== Test Case Report shows that Test Case are being Called Twice

*Question:* Test Case Report shows that the TCs are being called Twice
even though with debugging, it is known that this is not happening.

image:attachments/19857682/19988535.png[]

*Answer:* The reason why this might be happening is because the listeners
have been included in the suites twice causing it to print to the report
twice. Also, if the TC method is running with multiple context or vuser
values then the TC method will be printed out n number of times based on
that.
