= How do I get my TAF project into CI

== Introduction

This story comes from teams asking the question ``How do I get my
testware project into CI and how should my testcases get executed''. The
teams want to know what is the preferred strategy for developing,
building, deploying and executing their testware projects. There is a
clear ambition of how and where testware sits in the overall CI life
cycle of a product (as can be seen in many CI flow presentations). As
time progresses, more and more components of the overall ambition level
are being put in place. The purpose of this page is to outline the
current best practices / ways of working based on the components that
are available today. This page will be updated regularly to reflect any
changes to the latest position as more components of the overall
ambition level components are put in place.

This page hopes to address the following topics

- version strategy,
- storage of testware artifact
- branching strategy i.e. do we just need master & release??
- building of a testware artifact needs to be documented

== Version Strategy

This one is easy - maven will take care of this for us. Testware will
start off a 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT and the revision updates will be controlled
by maven (as per normal practices) and increased on every successful
release.

Should the team wish to change the major or minor version of the
artifact, then this would be done using the normal CI channels.

== Storage of Testware

Normal CI flow will also kick in here - as testware is built and
released it will be stored as jars in Nexus.

== Branching Strategy

Each team’s branching strategy for testware should mirror their
branching strategy for their application code. One question that pops up
here is, should a team use a `master' branch as well as a `Release'
branch - this will be up to the team to consider in line with their own
branching strategy (or be dictated by a higher level branching strategy
e.g. a TOR branching strategy).

In the absence of a clear strategy, the suggestion is that each team
build and release from their `master' branch.

== Build, Deploy, Run

This section will attempt to cover all that fits between a push in git
up to and including test cases being executed (and everything in
between). As you would expect we want to leverage the CI flow as much as
possible and have every step as automated as possible, so as you might
expect Jenkins, Maven and Git will be an integral part of this process.

=== Prerequisites:

Before we get into the "nuts and bolts" of how this will work we need to
take care of some prerequisites

==== Product number in top level pom

In order to be able to map testware to products and visa verse all
testware will need to have product numbers in the properties section of
your top level pom - see below for example

----
<properties>
......
    <CXP>CXP1234567</CXP>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
......
</properties>
----

Once the above is inserted in the pom, the testware - product mapping
can be done in the CI FWK portal.

==== Use the latest version of TAF

Obviously!!!!!

=== Building, deploying and running

As of now building, deploying and running testware will require two
jenkins jobs

* one job to build the testware and deploy the built artifact to Nexus -
will be done on a hub CI server
* second job to execute the testware - will be ran from a CI server in
the local ITTE network

WARNING: In the future there will be an additional steps to bring up test
         environments, deploy known good baseline software and subsequently
         execute testware against these deployments, this will be done as part of
         the overall CI flow. It may be materialized in the form of separate
         Jenkins jobs or possibly a pre steps in the Jenkins job that executes
         the testware.

==== Jenkins job #1 - build and deploy to Nexus

This is a standard jenkins job, it should have the following components

* restrict where the project is to be build - as this is a simple
  build job it can be built in the build farm e.g. "GridEngine_1

* SCM management - repo and branch to build
  image:attachments/26908680/27329443.jpg[image]
* build trigger - what ever way the team wants to trigger a build
* invoke top level maven target - minimum goals should be +-V -U clean deploy -Dskip.tests+
  image:attachments/26908680/27329444.jpg[image]

NOTE: a team may want to include extra maven goals e.g PMD, Cobertura / Jococo, etc

* post build step to call the jenkins testcase execution job

==== Jenkins job #2 - run the testware

This is a slightly less standard jenkins job, but it should have the
following components

* restrict where the project is to be build - we want this job to be
  executed on the CI server in the local ITTE network e.g "Integrationtest_1"
  image:attachments/26908680/27329447.jpg[image]
* build trigger - should be triggered by jenkins job #1
* SCM management - none
* might want to limit the time the build takes i.e. tick the
  "Abort the build if it’s stuck" and set a timeout

* invoke top level maven target - get the dependencies - see screen clip
  image:attachments/26908680/27329450.jpg[image]
* invoke top level maven target - run the tests - see screen clip
  image:attachments/26908680/27329451.jpg[image]
* post build step to publish the HTML and TestNG reporta - see screen clip
