CI Framework TAF - Interim Procedures
-------------------------------------

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-Steps]]
Steps
~~~~~

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-SetupIDE]]
Setup IDE
~~~~~~~~~

It is important that all developers create their IDE in a common way

Install Eclipse as per instruction
[http://atrclin2.athtem.eei.ericsson.se/wiki/index.php/Development_Environment_Setup[Development
Environment Setup]]

*Note:* Couple of things to ensure are in place before setting up the
server demo projects

* JDK
** It is stating the obvious but make sure a JDK is installed (not just
a JRE)
** JAVA_HOME is set as an environment viarable
* Ensure the Maven is installed
** settings.xml file is copied from the repo to
c:/Users/<your_ericsson_id>/.m2/ (as outlined in the above link)
** M2_HOME is set as an environment viarable

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-JCAT]]
JCAT
~~~~

There are a no of steps required to create test cases through JCAT.

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-Structure]]
Structure
+++++++++

If you have checked out the JCAT user guide yalready ou will see that
JCAT usage is layered:

1.  JCAT_FW
2.  JCAT extensions
3.  JCAT testcases and testsuites

To reflect this layering the demo projects are split up accordingly.
Standard project setup looks like this:

* JCAT_<your sut>_extensions
* JCAT_<your sut>_testcases

*Remember: *SUT = System Under Test. ie Node, Network Element etc.

* JCAT_<your sut>_extensions is where your specific extenstions (common
libraries) will be developed.
* JCAT_<your sut>_testcases is where your testcases and testsuites will
be developed

You need to add JCAT as a dependency in your maven project as detailed
below.

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-Getthedetailsofthelatestrelease.]]
Get the details of the latest release.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  open the following
link: https://eforge.lmera.ericsson.se/sf/frs/do/listReleases/projects.jcat/frs.jcat_ng[eforge.lmera.ericsson.se/sf/frs/do/listReleases/projects.jcat/frs.jcat_ng]
2.  Select the release with ``General Availability'' in the Maturity
column.
3.  Note the Group Id, Artifact Id and the version of the jcat-fw and
jcat-extensions in the description.

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-Addthedependencies.]]
Add the dependencies.
+++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Open eclipse
2.  Open the pom.xml file of your project.
3.  Switch to the dependencies tab.
4.  Click Add.
5.  Enter the Group Id, Artifact Id and version for the JCAT framework
and JCAT extensions.

 

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-TestCaseAutomation]]
Test Case Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write the Test Cases and push to GIT

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-TestCaseNamingConvention]]
Test Case Naming Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is very important that all Test Cases can be mapped and tracked
within the project. This is vital in identifying progress and quality.
As such, the naming of the test cases is important to ensure that the
test results can ultimately be tracked back to User Stories.

The following naming convention has been identified

TC_<User Story ID>_<Test Obj>_<TCID>

e.g. (only for example’s sake…real id’s to be added)

---------------------
  TC_TORSF50_Perf_001
  TC_TORSF50_Perf_002
  TC_TORSF50_Perf_003
  TC_TORSF50_Load_001
  TC_TORSF50_Load_002
  TC_TORSF50_Func_001
  TC_TORSF50_Func_002
  TC_TORSF50_Func_003
---------------------

GIT push
^^^^^^^^

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-BuildTestWare]]
Build TestWare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The testware will be build as part of a jenkins job - see following
section for details

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-ConfigureJenkins]]
Configure Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Check the code out from GIT
2.  Compile and build the code
3.  Package the dependencies
4.  Place the test artifact on the SUT

A new Jenkins job should be created to build the test cases for each
project, when created this job the main steps are

1.  Go the Jenkins home page and click on `New Job'
2.  Give the new job a name of your choice
3.  Select the `Build a maven2/3 project' option and click ok
4.  A new job configuration window will open - give the job a
description if required
5.  If applicable, choose what slave the job is to be run on by checking
the `Restrict where this project can be run' box and input the Jenkins
slave name
6.  In the Source Code Mangagement section, click `Git' option and input
the repository url required to download the project from Git
7.  If preferred, select the preferred branch to build or leave blank
for the default option
8.  In the `Build' section add the filename for the `Root POM' file -
e.g. `pom.xml'
9.  Input the Maven `Goals and options' - usually ``clean install''
10. In the `Post Build Actions' section, check the box for `Archive the
arifacts' - this will ensure the files created on the Jenkins slave a
run time will get pulled back to the Jenkins master
11. In the `Files to archive' section, input the names of the files to
be archived or `**' to archive all files
12. Check the box for `Publish TestNG Results' and input report pattern
that Jenkins will use to search for the TestNG report file generated by
JCAT e.g. `**/test-output/testng-results.xml'
13. Check the boxes for `Escape Test description string?' & `Escape
exception messages?'
14. Click on `Save' to save the job

 

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-DeployTargetEnvironment]]
Deploy Target Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At present this is a purely manual step!

\1) Deploy LITP

\2) Ensure JBOSS is installed and running

------------------------
 service jboss-as status
------------------------

\3) Ensure TOR software is deployed

-----------------
Steps to be added
.................
-----------------

\4) Deploy Testware to Jenkins slave running JBOSS

-----------------
Steps to be added
.................
-----------------

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-RunTestCases]]
Run Test Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  By including a Test Runner main method in the packaged jar file
2.  By invoking the TestNG runner on xml file containing the list of
test cases

 

------------------------------------------------------
$ java $vmargs -classpath $CLASSPATH $mainclass $suite
------------------------------------------------------

 

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-ConfigureTestStatistics]]
Configure Test Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  The host executing the test cases must be able to contact the Kista
hub
2.  A properties file (usually called logdb.properties) needs to be
included in the project resource folder, this properties file holds the
information on the path and access to the TS database in the Kista hub
3.  The location of this file needs to be passed as a VM argument
(-Dlogdb.configuration) at run time
4.  An extra logwriter -
`se.ericsson.jcat.fw.ng.logging.writers.DbLogWriterRIPNG' needs to be
passed as a VM argument (-Dlogwriters) at runtime
5.  A name to identify the test run in the TS database needs to be
passed as VM argument (-Dname) at run time.

[[InterimProcessforworkingwithTAF,innonfullyautomatedenvironment-EnsureallTestArtifactsarerecovered]]
Ensure all Test Artifacts are recovered
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\1) Jenkins must be configured to collect all relevent logs and retrieve
to Master

\2) If necessary use JCAT "_fetch logs_" to retrieve logs stored on
remote system
