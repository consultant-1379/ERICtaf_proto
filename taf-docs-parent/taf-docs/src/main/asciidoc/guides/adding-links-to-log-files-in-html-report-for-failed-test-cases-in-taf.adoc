Adding links to log files in HTML report for failed test cases in TAF
=====================================================================

[[AddinglinkstologfilesinHTMLreportforfailedtestcasesinTAF-Howdoesitwork]]
How does it work
----------------

As part of it’s monitoring feature, TAF gathers information from
relevant log files during a test run.

This is done by reading the contents of the log file on the system under
test (see pages on OsLogMonitor and AsLogMonitor for more details on
this) and translating each line into a log entry.

This log entry object is then stored in a cache where it can be
retrieved later. It is now possible, when a failure occurs, to retrieve
this information from the cache and recreate the log file using TAF
functionality.

Links to the recreated log filescan be added to the HTML test report as
shown below.

What are the default settings
-----------------------------

The default settings for this feature in TAF are as follows:-

----
#FailLogger
faillogger.onfail.gatherall=true
faillogger.onfail.clearcache=false
----

[[AddinglinkstologfilesinHTMLreportforfailedtestcasesinTAF-faillogger.onfail.gatheral:]]
faillogger.onfail.gatheral:

This setting specifies whether or not you want to create the log files
and and add the links to the HTML report when a failure occurs.

[[AddinglinkstologfilesinHTMLreportforfailedtestcasesinTAF-faillogger.onfail.clearcache:]]
faillogger.onfail.clearcache:

With this option it is possible to clear the cache when a fail occurs,
this may be useful when there are more than one failure so that there is
no duplication in the created log files

[[AddinglinkstologfilesinHTMLreportforfailedtestcasesinTAF-WhatdoIneedtotodoenablethisfeature]]
What do I need to to do enable this feature
-------------------------------------------

To use this feature you will need to be using the latest version of TAF
(more specifically the latest TafRun.groovy).

The default behaviour can be overridden by specifying your preferences
for the properties above in a properties file in the ``taf_properties''
folder in your TAF project.
