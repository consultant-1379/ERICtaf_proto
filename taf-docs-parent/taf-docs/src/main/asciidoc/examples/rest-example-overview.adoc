Left part of class diagram shows the data flow and right part shows the
logic flow. 

Top layer is Test layer - it is not shared between teams and does not
contain ``business'' logic - doesn’t define how to operate on System. 

Middle layer is Operator - it is shared between the teams inside
taf-tor-operators project. It contains all the business logic required
to execute actions on System. It contains both generic and contextual
Operators and Data Provider to fetch data from the system.

Lowest layer contains mappings of points exposed by SUT. This layer is
shared between the teams and is created to easily manage changes of SUT.

 

RestTool is containing System Under Test using some implementation of
rest tool (e.g. JMeter or cURL).
