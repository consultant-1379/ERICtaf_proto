</ul></div></h1><h1 id="Waysofworking-Developtheoperator">Develop the operator</h1><p>During your sprint (or perhaps at the spring planning stage) you identify the need for a particular operator. You check the TAF TOR operators project to see if such an operator already exits and if not you decide that you will develop this operator during your sprint. As the sprint progresses the functionality of the operator progresses and by the end of the sprint you have an operator that satisfies your need. At this stage you are using the operator and you automated tests are passing but you think that you would like to share this operator with the other teams in TOR because if you share it and someone is able to make use of it then obviously they won't have to spend time developing and that time can be put to better use i.e. progressing TOR development.</p><h1 id="Waysofworking-Addtheoperatortotheoperatorproject">Add the operator to the operator project</h1><p>Ok, your sprint is over and you have decided that you will share your operator but think &quot;I'm not sure it is ready for general availability just yet&quot; so you may spend a little time re-factoring and before long you operator is ready for release. You will pull down the latest version (see previous page for link to git), you move your operator from your TAF project to the TAF TOR Operator project and adjust your TAF project accordingly. Do a git push and monitor the <a href="https://cifwk-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/jenkins/view/TAF+CI/job/TAF_TOR_Operators/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Jenkins job </a>for the operators project to make sure the project builds ok and you are good to go.</p><h1 id="Waysofworking-UsingTAFTOROperatorsprojectcomparedtousingdirectly">Using TAF TOR Operators project compared to using directly</h1><p>Previously TAF functionality (typically taf-core) would have been directly added to the pom of your test project as a dependency. This will change if you use the operators project. The new procedure would be to replace the dependency on taf-core with a dependency on the operators project (see below for the syntax). Your project will still have all the functionality of taf-core as the operators project has a dependency on taf-core.</p><div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">

</div></div><h1 id="Waysofworking-Updateconfluencepages">Update confluence pages</h1><p>The build has passed so it's time to tell the world that you have added a new operator to the project. Add the operator details to the table of operators in the <a href="http://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/TAF/List+of+TAF+TOR+Operators" rel="nofollow">confluence page</a>. Create a child page (based on the example) to hold the detailed information about your operator - things like how to use it, possible future development that you did not get to do, and known issues etc.</p>
